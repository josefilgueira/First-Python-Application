# 🐍 First Python Application  
This repository contains the very first Python program I developed during my Master’s degree.  
It is a beginner-friendly exercise focused on working with user input, validation, functions, and control flow.

## 📘 Project Description

The goal of the task was to create a small Python program capable of:

- Asking the user for a **secret number** (hidden input)
- Validating that the input is **numeric**
- Ensuring the number is an **integer**
- Checking that it lies within a **defined numeric range**
- Repeating the prompt until a valid number is entered

The program uses the `getpass` module to hide the user’s input, simulating how passwords or secret values are normally handled.

This assignment helped me understand:
- How to structure simple functions in Python  
- How to perform input validation  
- How to work with loops and error handling  
- How user interaction works in console applications  

It represents my first steps into Python programming and was part of the foundational learning stage in my journey toward Data Science.
